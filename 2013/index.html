				In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world&rsquo;s first
				photomontage by combining five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on
				her deathbed. &ldquo;Fading Away&rdquo;&mdash;Robinson&rsquo;s first and most famous composite
				photo&mdash;depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited,
				with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.
